# xml.nim
Simple XML parser in pure Nim


This module written for *compile time* XML parsing purpose, it supports only some features:

- Nodes
- Atrributes
- CDATA and Text

> The parser is simple and small, no error checking/correcting. Use it as your own risk*

If you need a more powerful XML/HTML parser, consider using [parsexml](https://nim-lang.org/docs/parsexml.html)
